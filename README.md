# colormixer
A tool to demonstrate the relationships between decimals and fractions using color.  For hands on and visual learners.

## Demonstration
Demonstrate how colors on a computer monitor, and other mediums of light, work slightly different than colors in paints and pigments, like they were taught in art class (praying that they still have art class).  Computer screens use a color theory called the "Additive Theory of Color", in which the primary colors are Red, Green and Blue (RGB).  However pigments like paint and magazine ink use the "Subtractive Theory of Color" where the primary colors are Magenta, Yellow, and Cyan (Turquoise).

"Why were we taught Red Yellow and Blue in elementary school?"  Two reasons:
1) We didn't know any better for along times.  Artists have used Red, Yellow, and Blue in their mixing theory for centuries before the Subtractive Theory of Color was understood.
2) It's easier for children because they are more familiar with the colors Red, yellow, and Blue, and they are close enough to Magenta, Yellow, and Cyan that it works well enough.
So basically, the short answer is, because we always did it that way.  :-)

We are going to use decimals and fractions to mix colors on the computer screen, using the three Additive primary colors, Red, Green, and Blue.  Computers represent the intensity of each color using a ratio between 0 and 1.  0 means that there is no "saturation", or intensity at all.  The color will be completely dim shining no light, so you will see black.  1 means that the color is at full intensity, so you will see the color at its brightest.

You can combine colors at different saturations to get an infinate variety of colors.  

* Red, Green, and Blue - Set all the sliders to 0 (default) and then in turn, slowly slide each primary color to full saturation with the other colors still turned all the way down.  Demonstrate how the saturation of each color gets stronger as the slider approaches 1.  This is also a good time to point out that the fractions are not showing thier simplified versions, but are displayed according to the place values of the decimal numbers.  For instance, the equivalent of 0.19 will be show as 19/100 because 0.19 occupies the hundreths place.  Yet, the equivalent of 0.2 will display 2/10 because 0.2 only occupies the tenths place, even though it is equivalent to both 20/100 and 1/5.

* Black - Set all the sliders to 0 (this is the default), and show that 0.0 is equivalent to 0/10.  Explain that black is what you get when there is absolutely no saturation of color.

* White - Set all the sliders to 1, and show that 1 is equivalent to 1/1.  Explain that white is what you get when all three colors are at full saturation.  They see the combined color in the background, and each individual color's saturation in the foreground.  

* Grey - Ask the students to guess what color they think you will get if you set all three sliders half way.  Then demonstrate grey by setting all the sliders half way to reinforce that grey is half way between white and black.  If the sliders are clumbsy, you can set it perfectly half way by  setting the decimals to 0.5.  Point out that 0.5 is equivalent to a half as well as 5/10.

* Secondary colors - Demonstrate yellow by sliding Blue all the way down to 0, and sliding both Red and Yellow all the way up to one to turn the background yellow.  Explain that in the spectrum of light, red light mixed with green light makes yellow light.  Do the same with the other secondary colors
  * Blue and Green make Turquoise/Cyan
  * Red and Blue make Magenta

## Hands on learning
Give the students the fractions or decimals that they need for each primary color in order to make certain blends.  Have them tell you the names of the color they created.  Use terms like "half", "quarter", "three quarters", "a thrid" "two thirds" where possible, or "tenths" and "hundreths".  You might want to write the names of the colors in a word box on the board or on paper to help them name the colors correctly.

If you have a large touch screen available, students can take turns finding colors at the front of the class, or they can all participate from their seats if they have laptops available.  It could also be performed as a center, performance task, or small group lesson. 

> Caution:  Maybe it's just computer weirdness or a case of "everything we think we know is wrong", but certain values may not give you what you expect.  For instance, putting "green" all the way up actually gives you what we call "lime" which is a much higher saturation than green.  What we call "green" is actually 0.5 saturation on the Green range.  So no, your eyes aren't playing tricks on you, but I recommend keeping things simple, and avoid the topic unless a student brings it up.
